# Assessment Project

This repository contains the notebooks and related files for the assessment project.

## Overview

This project consists of several assignments that were completed in Google Colab. The code and analyses are contained in Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb). The purpose of this repository is to showcase the solution to each assignment, and they are organized as separate notebooks for clarity.

## Files

- `SOLX_Assessment_Data_Exploratory_Analysis_Cunanan.ipynb`: 
- `SOLX_Assessment_Forecasting_Cunanan.ipynb`

### Running the Notebooks

Since the assessments were done using **Google Colab**, the notebooks can be opened and executed directly in Colab. 

1. Open the desired `.ipynb` notebook file in Google Colab.
   - You can do this by clicking on the respective notebook file in the repository and then selecting "Open in Colab" from the top of the GitHub page, or by directly uploading the file to Google Colab.
